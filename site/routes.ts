 *   • build.mjs  emits sitemap.xml and robots.txt from PAGES, and injects the
 *                canonical / og: / JSON-LD head block into each built page.
 *   • the tests  assert that what is routed and what is advertised agree.
 *
 * That is the point: a sitemap hand-maintained beside a router drifts within a
 * week, and the failure is silent — you advertise a URL that 404s, or serve one
 * Google never hears about. Here, adding a page is ONE entry in PAGES and it is
 * simultaneously routed, redirected from its .html form, listed in the sitemap
 * (or Disallowed), and given a canonical tag.
